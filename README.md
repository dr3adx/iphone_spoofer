God forbid you ever lose your phone you WOULD NOT believe the amount of YOUR info photos store!
In fact apple made it VERY hard to even forge the photos by adding binary hash-checked payload so any edits to it are impossible due to undisclosed Apple's proprietary decryption code.

This tool makes your photos taken on an old iphone look like they've been taken on a modern iphone. This can be very useful in some cases.

Some background:
All the photos you take contain EXIF data about **you**, **where you are** and much more. Very scary stuff.
